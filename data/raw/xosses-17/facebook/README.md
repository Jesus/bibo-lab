I couldn't find an easy way to download all pictures from a Facebook album.

It should be possible to download using their API, however I'm leaving this
for now as we have enough images from other sources to get started.

Just as a note for the future, I'll include the links to the relevant albums
here:

 1. Album "les xosses de crevillent 2017", Pedro Carrillo.
